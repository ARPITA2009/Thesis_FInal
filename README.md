An Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma from Histopathological Image

For classifying histopathological images into IDC and IDC - categories, four different deep CNNs DenseNet, ResNet, Xception and VGG19 are trained on histological images and to get advantages to every deep CNNs and optimize the model performance, both stacking and weighted average ensemble methods has been used. Ensembled loss function is also used for getting advantages of each loss function. In this project , the proposed loss function is a combination of MAE, Hinge, and Binary Cross-Entropy loss functions, leading to a more robust, generalized, and improved probability estimator respectively.
